# CGReplay

## Setup

### Submodules
This project uses Git submodules. To properly initialize them, run:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

### Python Environment Setup

#### For Frame Generation Component
The frame generation component requires Python 3.8. You can install it using the deadsnakes PPA:

```bash
# Add deadsnakes PPA
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update

# Install Python 3.8 and required packages
sudo apt install python3.8 python3.8-venv python3.8-dev
```

#### For Quality Metrics Tools
The quality metrics tools require Python 3.12.2. See the Quality Metrics Tools section for setup instructions.

#### OpenCV with GStreamer Support
The CGReplay player component requires OpenCV built with GStreamer support to properly handle video streams. Pre-built packages from pip typically lack this support, so you'll need to build OpenCV from source:

1. First, install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake git pkg-config \
    libgtk-3-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev \
    libv4l-dev libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev libjpeg-dev \
    libpng-dev libtiff-dev gfortran openexr \
    libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev \
    python3-dev python3-numpy libatlas-base-dev
```

2. Clone the OpenCV repositories:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/opencv_build && cd ~/opencv_build
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git
```

3. Configure the build with CMake (adjust paths to match your environment):
```bash
mkdir -p ~/opencv_build/build && cd ~/opencv_build/build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \
      -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/your/virtualenv \
      -D INSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=ON \
      -D INSTALL_C_EXAMPLES=OFF \
      -D OPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE=ON \
      -D WITH_GSTREAMER=ON \
      -D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=~/opencv_build/opencv_contrib/modules \
      -D BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON \
      -D PYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/python \
      -D PYTHON_DEFAULT_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/python \
      ../opencv
```

4. Build and install (replace `8` with the number of CPU cores you want to use):
```bash
make -j8
make install
```

5. Verify that OpenCV has GStreamer support:
```bash
python -c "import cv2; print(cv2.getBuildInformation())" | grep -i gstreamer
```
   You should see `GStreamer: YES` in the output.

## Project Components

### 1. RTP Video Tools

A pair of Python scripts for working with video streams over RTP networks. These tools enable you to create packet captures (PCAPs) of H.264/H.265 video streams and extract the original video from such captures.

#### Overview

- **rtp_video_packetizer.py**: Converts a series of PNG images into an H.264/H.265 video stream, creates RTP packets for network transmission, and stores them in a PCAP file.
- **rtp_video_extractor.py**: Extracts H.264/H.265 video from RTP packets in a PCAP file and reconstructs the original video stream.

#### Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Scapy (`pip install scapy`)
- FFmpeg (must be installed and available in your PATH)

Additional Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install scapy
```

#### Usage

##### Creating RTP Video Packets (PCAP)

```bash
python rtp_video_packetizer.py
```

This script will:
1. Read PNG frames from the specified directory
2. Encode them to H.264/H.265 using FFmpeg
3. Packetize the encoded video into RTP packets
4. Save the packets as a PCAP file

Configuration options are defined within the script, including:
- Image source directory
- Output PCAP filename
- Network parameters (IP addresses, ports)
- Video codec (H.264 or H.265)

##### Extracting Video from PCAP

```bash
python rtp_video_extractor.py input_pcap.pcap [-o output_video.mp4] [-c codec]
```

Arguments:
- `input_pcap.pcap`: Path to the input PCAP file (default: 'rtp_stream_h264.pcap')
- `-o, --output`: Path to the output video file (default: 'output.mp4')
- `-c, --codec`: Video codec ('h264' or 'h265', default: 'h264')

Example:
```bash
python rtp_video_extractor.py rtp_stream_h264_fixed.pcap -o extracted_video.mp4 -c h264
```

### 2. Frame Generation and Degradation Toolkit

4. **Video Utilities** (`frame_gen/tools/video_utils.py`)
   - Collection of utility functions for video processing
   - Includes functions for reading, writing, resizing, and frame rate modification
   - Can be imported as a Python module

For detailed usage instructions of each quality metrics tool, please refer to the README.md in the `frame_gen/tools` directory.

## Notes

- All tools require Python 3.12.2 or higher
- Some tools (like LPIPS) require CUDA-capable GPU for optimal performance
- Make sure your input videos/frames have matching dimensions when comparing them
- The tools are designed to work with common video formats (MP4) and image formats (PNG)

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure FFmpeg is properly installed and available in your PATH
- Check that your PNG images are valid and can be encoded by FFmpeg
- For extraction problems, verify that the PCAP contains valid RTP packets with H.264/H.265 payload
- Malformed or incomplete packets in the PCAP file may result in corrupted video output
- For quality metrics tools, ensure you have the correct Python version and all dependencies installed
- For the CGReplay server and player:
  - When a game is specified in `config.yaml` (under `Running:game`), ensure a folder with the same name exists in the `server/` directory (e.g., if game is set to "Kombat", you need a `server/Kombat/` folder)
  - The game folder must contain frames in sequential order
   - Both `player/` and `server/` directories must have a `logs` folder created in them for proper operation

## Installing FFmpeg with VMAF Support

VMAF (Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion) is a perceptual video quality metric developed by Netflix. To use VMAF-based quality metrics in this project, you need to build and install both libvmaf and ffmpeg with VMAF support. This section provides step-by-step instructions for Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 (adapt as needed for your system).

### 1. Install Build Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git build-essential pkg-config libtool \
    libssl-dev yasm cmake python3-venv meson ninja-build nasm \
    libass-dev libfreetype6-dev libtheora-dev libvorbis-dev \
    libx264-dev libx265-dev libnuma-dev
```

### 2. Clone and Build libvmaf

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf.git
cd vmaf
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
cd ..
```

### 3. Clone and Build ffmpeg with VMAF Support

```bash
git clone https://git.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git ffmpeg
cd ffmpeg
./configure --enable-gpl --enable-libx264 --enable-libx265 --enable-libvmaf
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
cd ..
```

### 4. Verify VMAF Support in ffmpeg

You can verify that ffmpeg was built with VMAF support by running:

```bash
ffmpeg -filters | grep vmaf
```

You should see output similar to:

```
.. libvmaf           VV->V      Calculate the VMAF between two video streams.
.. vmafmotion        V->V       Calculate the VMAF Motion score.
```

### 5. Example Usage

To compute the VMAF score between two videos:

```bash
ffmpeg -i reference.mp4 -i distorted.mp4 -lavfi "[0:v][1:v]libvmaf" -f null -
```

This will print VMAF scores to the console.

**Tip:** For more advanced usage and options, refer to the official [FFmpeg VMAF documentation](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#libvmaf).

## Reproducing Video Quality Analysis Results

To reproduce the video quality analysis results from network experiments, follow these steps in order:

### Step 1: Extract Video Frames from Network Captures

Use the RTP video extractor to extract video frames from PCAP files:

```bash
python rtp_video_extractor.py [options] input.pcap
```

This will extract the video frames from the network capture and save them for analysis.

### Step 2: Generate Quality Metrics CSV Files

Run the video quality analysis tool to compute detailed metrics and generate CSV files:

```bash
python video_quality_plots.py [options]
```

This script will:
- Compare extracted video frames against reference frames
- Calculate quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, VMAF)
- Generate detailed CSV files with per-frame metrics
- Create individual quality plots

### Step 3: Generate Comparison Plots

Use the loss comparison plotting tool to create comparative analysis plots:

```bash
# Interactive mode (recommended)
python loss_comparison_plots.py --interactive

# Direct command-line usage
python loss_comparison_plots.py --game Kombat --experiment loss --scenario-group 4Mbit
```

This script will:
- Automatically discover available games, experiments, and scenario groups
- Aggregate metrics from multiple detailed CSV files
- Generate 2x2 subplot comparisons showing all scenarios for each metric
- Save plots with descriptive names (e.g., `Kombat_loss_4Mbit_comparison.png`)

The resulting plots will show PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and VMAF comparisons across different network conditions (e.g., 4Mbit, 4Mbit_Loss10, 4Mbit_Loss20, 4Mbit_Loss30) with average values displayed in the legend.

### Troubleshooting VMAF/FFmpeg Build

- **Missing `nasm` or build tools:**
  - If you see errors about `nasm` not found, install it with:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install nasm
    ```
  - For `meson`, `ninja`, or `python3-venv` errors, install with:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install meson ninja-build python3-venv
    ```

- **libvmaf build fails with missing dependencies:**
  - Make sure all dependencies listed above are installed.
  - If you get errors related to Python or Meson, try recreating the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install meson ninja
    make clean
    make
    ```

- **libvmaf package not available in your distribution:**
  - Building from source (as shown above) is the recommended approach and ensures you get the latest version.

- **`ninja: error: loading 'build.ninja': No such file or directory`**
  - This means the Meson setup step failed. Try running:
    ```bash
    .venv/bin/meson setup libvmaf/build libvmaf --buildtype release -Denable_float=true
    .venv/bin/meson compile -C libvmaf/build
    sudo .venv/bin/meson install -C libvmaf/build
    ```

- **ffmpeg does not detect libvmaf:**
  - Make sure `sudo ldconfig` was run after installing libvmaf.
  - Ensure `--enable-libvmaf` was passed to `./configure` when building ffmpeg.
  - If you installed ffmpeg before libvmaf, rebuild ffmpeg after installing libvmaf.

- **General advice:**
  - Always check the output of each command for errors.
  - Consult the official documentation for [libvmaf](https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf) and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).

## Practical Usage: ffmpeg with VMAF

VMAF is a video quality metric designed to compare a reference (original) video with a distorted (processed or compressed) video. It does not generate a new video; instead, it outputs a quality score or report.

### Basic Usage: Compare Two Videos

Suppose you have:
- `reference.mp4`: the original, high-quality video
- `distorted.mp4`: the video to evaluate (e.g., after compression)

Run:

```bash
ffmpeg -i reference.mp4 -i distorted.mp4 -lavfi "[0:v][1:v]libvmaf" -f null -
```

This will print VMAF scores to the terminal.

### Save VMAF Results as JSON

To generate a JSON file with detailed VMAF statistics (including per-frame scores and the mean), use:

```bash
ffmpeg -i reference.mp4 -i distorted.mp4 \
  -lavfi "[0:v][1:v]libvmaf=log_path=vmaf.json:log_fmt=json" -f null -
```

This will create a file called `vmaf.json` containing:
- The VMAF score for each frame
- The mean (average) VMAF score and other summary statistics

You can use this JSON file for further analysis or plotting with Python, Excel, or other tools.

### Compare Videos of Different Resolutions

If the videos have different resolutions, scale them to match:

```bash
ffmpeg -i reference.mp4 -i distorted.mp4 \
  -lavfi "[0:v]scale=1920:1080[ref];[1:v]scale=1920:1080[dist];[ref][dist]libvmaf" \
  -f null -
```

### Manually Generate a Video from PNG Frames

If you want to manually generate a video with 30 fps from PNG frames for evaluation, use the following command:

```bash
ffmpeg -framerate 30 -i %04d.png -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4
```

Make sure to run this command in the correct directory containing your PNG frames, or specify the full path to the frames (e.g., `path/to/frames/%04d.png`). Adjust the frame rate or other parameters if needed for your specific evaluation.

### Tips
- The videos must have the same frame count and be synchronized.
- Use `-an` to ignore audio streams if needed.
- You can add other metrics (e.g., `feature=name=psnr`) to the filter.

  - [FFmpeg libvmaf filter documentation](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#libvmaf)
  - [Netflix VMAF GitHub](https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf)
